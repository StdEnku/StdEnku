# Do you know a Buddhist monk named Enku?

Enku was a Buddhist monk, sculptor, and poet who lived in the early Edo period in Japan.   
He is famous for having carved about 120,000 wooden Buddhist statues in his unique style.   
These Buddhist statues are known as "Enku-butsu. Enku did not donate or sell his Buddha images to temples or individuals,   
but freely distributed them to anyone who wanted them.   
This is similar to the free software philosophy that software should be free to use, distribute, modify,   
and redistribute. Enku also inscribed his signature or message on the back of the statue. These are called "back inscriptions.   
This is similar to the principle of the free software philosophy that source code should be made public and copyright notices should remain.   
Enku also inscribed the words "Mokujishisaku Daimyojin" on his statue. This implies that he respected the "Mokujido," or wood carving material,   
and that making a statue with it was a sacred act. This is similar to the values of the free software philosophy,   
which holds that software is the common property of mankind and that it is noble to create with it.

I respect him and want to be like him.
