# Do you know a Buddhist monk named Enku?

Enku was a Buddhist monk, sculptor and poet who lived in the early Edo period in Japan. He is famous for carving about 120,000 wooden statues of Buddha with a unique style. These statues are called “Enku Buddhas”.

Enku did not donate or sell his statues to temples or individuals, but freely distributed them to anyone who wanted them. This is similar to the idea of free software philosophy, which says that software should be free to use, distribute, modify and redistribute.

Enku also carved his signature and message on the back of his statues. These are called “back inscriptions”. This is similar to the principle of free software philosophy, which says that source code should be made public and copyright notice should be kept.

Enku also carved the words “Mokujido Saku Daimyojin” on his statues. This means that he respected the material of wood carving, which is called “mokujido”, and that making statues out of it was a sacred act. This is similar to the value of free software philosophy, which says that software is a common property of humanity and that creating with it is a noble thing.

I admire Enku for his dedication and generosity in sharing his art with the world.
